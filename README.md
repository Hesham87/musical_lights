# **Practical Python Programming for IoT Devices**

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and examples implementing various methodologies and techniques learned from the book "Practical Python Programming for IoT Devices". The aim of this project is to provide practical examples and solutions for developing IoT applications using Python.

## **Overview**

The book covers a wide range of topics related to IoT development using Python, including:

- **Event Loops and Threading**: Techniques for managing asynchronous operations using event loops and threads.
- **Publisher-Subscriber Methods**: Implementations of publisher-subscriber patterns for efficient communication between components.
- **SPI Control for APA102 Light Strip**: Utilization of SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) to control APA102 light strips and logic level converters.
- **Networking with MQTT and Flask APIs**: Implementation of networking functionalities using MQTT for messaging and Flask for building RESTful APIs.
